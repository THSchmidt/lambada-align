# LAMBADA FAQ #

## What does _LAMBADA_ stand for? ##

Nobody ever asked before. However, if you would like to know or not:
  * LAMBADA is a dance; Inflategro actually not.
  * It's neither the nickname of a city in the Netherlands nor a cocktail
  * Okay, in the current version it fits _LAndscape-Methodological and Belt Analysis Driven Approach_ for orienting membrane proteins
  * It does not depend on the earth curvature
  * The last three points are forming a belt of nonsense and should represent (metaphorically) the characteristic hydrophobic belt region on the surface of a protein by linguistic recursion
